=head1 NAME

Configd::Language::postfix - main.cf and master.cf, which postfix has never had
a conf.d for.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Configd();

    Configd->adopt('postfix');    # main.cf and master.cf become generated
    Configd->build('postfix');    # which is what the systemd drop-in then runs

From a shell, which is how it is actually used:

=over 4

=item C<configd adopt postfix>

=item C<< printf 'mydestination = example.com\n' > /etc/postfix/main.cf.d/50-example.cf >>

=item C<systemctl restart postfix>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Postfix has C<postconf -e> and nothing else.  It sets a parameter by rewriting
C<main.cf>, which is fine for a person at a terminal and wrong for anything
automated: two things configuring the same server cannot both set
C<mydestination>, because the second one to run replaces what the first wrote
rather than adding to it.  Hosting two domains on one mail server is enough to
hit it, and the failure is quiet -- mail for the first domain simply stops being
local.

So C<main.cf> and C<master.cf> become generated files with C<main.cf.d> and
C<master.cf.d> beside them, and each domain drops in a fragment naming itself.
The parameters that are lists are merged as lists; see L</ACCUMULATING PARAMETERS>.

=head2 What the fragments look like

Exactly like the file they add to, because that is the point -- anything you
would have written in C<main.cf> is a fragment:

    # /etc/postfix/main.cf.d/50-example.com.cf
    mydestination = example.com
    virtual_mailbox_domains = example.com
    virtual_mailbox_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual/maps

=head1 ACCUMULATING PARAMETERS

=cut

# The parameters where two fragments each naming something both meant it.  This
# is the list postfix's own documentation describes as taking "a comma and/or
# space separated list of domain names" and friends -- setting one of these from
# two places is the case this whole distribution exists for.
#
# Deliberately not here: the *_restrictions parameters.  They are lists too, but
# ordered ones where the meaning depends on which check comes first and a
# permit_ in the wrong place opens a relay.  Joining two of them end to end
# produces something that parses and is not what either fragment meant, so they
# stay a value a later fragment replaces, and disagreeing about one is something
# somebody should have to notice.
my %ACCUMULATES = map { $_ => 1 } qw{
  mydestination
  myhostname_aliases
  masquerade_domains
  mynetworks

  proxy_read_maps
};

=pod

C<sender_dependent_relayhost_maps> and C<smtpd_sender_login_maps> are here for
the same reason as the rest and were missed the first time, which is worth
naming because the second one fails dangerously.  It is what
C<reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch> reads, so a host where it does not
accumulate ends up naming one domain's table -- and every other domain's users,
whose addresses are then owned by nobody, are refused when they try to send.

The parameters postfix documents as comma-or-space separated lists, where two
fragments each naming a domain, a map or a milter both meant it:
C<mydestination>, C<mynetworks>, C<relay_domains>, the C<virtual_*> family, the
C<*_maps> and C<*_checks> families, C<smtpd_milters> and C<inet_interfaces>
among them.  Anything else is a value, and a later fragment replaces it.

The C<*_restrictions> parameters are deliberately B<not> accumulated even though
they are lists.  They are ordered, the order is what they mean, and joining two
of them end to end gives something that parses and that neither fragment asked
for -- a C<permit_> landing ahead of a check that was supposed to run first is
an open relay.  Two fragments disagreeing about a restriction list is something
a person should look at.

=head1 WHAT THIS DOES NOT REACH: THE LOOKUP TABLES

main.cf is full of paths, and none of them are this language's business.
C<virtual_mailbox_maps> names a file of addresses; C<header_checks> names a file
of patterns; C<check_recipient_access> names one from inside a restriction list.
Adopting main.cf merges the parameters that B<name> those tables and does
nothing whatever to the tables themselves, which is worth saying out loud
because the parameter merging cleanly is exactly what makes it easy to believe
the problem is solved.

Where the parameter accumulates the tables come along for free, because postfix
searches a list of them in order.  Two domains each writing their own file and
each naming it is enough:

    # 50-first.example.com
    virtual_mailbox_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual/first.example.com

    # 50-second.example.com
    virtual_mailbox_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual/second.example.com

That is the whole answer for C<virtual_mailbox_maps>, C<virtual_alias_maps>,
C<transport_maps>, C<header_checks> and the rest of the accumulating list, and
it needs nothing from this distribution.

It is B<not> available for a table named from inside a restriction list.
C<check_recipient_access pcre:/etc/postfix/recipient_access> lives inside
C<smtpd_recipient_restrictions>, which does not accumulate and must not, so the
path in it is whatever the last fragment to mention that parameter said.  Every
domain therefore shares one table, and the second one provisioned overwrites the
first one's -- the same failure adopting main.cf was meant to end, one level
down and out of reach.

Two things follow, and both are the caller's rather than this language's:

=over 4

=item * A shared table has to be B<assembled> rather than merged, because these
are ordered files.  A pcre or regexp table is read top to bottom and the first
match wins, so a catch-all belongs at the end and concatenating two domains'
tables puts one in the middle.  Numeric prefixes on the fragments, and the
catch-all last, is the shape that works -- the same shape configd gives a config
file, which is not a coincidence but is not implemented here either.

=item * Before building any of that, check whether the table is needed at all.
Postfix rejects a recipient in a virtual mailbox domain that is absent from
C<virtual_mailbox_maps> by itself -- "User unknown in virtual mailbox table" --
and one in a local domain absent from C<local_recipient_maps> likewise, so an
access table written to reject unknown recipients is often restating a check
postfix already makes, and is only load-bearing because the configuration has a
domain in two address classes at once.  L<https://www.postfix.org/ADDRESS_CLASS_README.html>
is the page; C<VIRTUAL_README> is blunter about it: "NEVER list a virtual
MAILBOX domain name as a mydestination domain!"

=head1 METHODS

=head2 files()

C<main.cf> and C<master.cf>.

=head2 units()

C<postfix@.service>, the templated unit.

=head2 services()

C<postfix.service>, which is what can actually be restarted.

    );
}

sub units {

    # The templated unit rather than postfix.service: on Debian and Ubuntu
    # postfix.service is a oneshot whose ExecStart is /bin/true, and the daemon
    # that actually reads these files is an instance of postfix@.service --
    # postfix@-.service being the default one.  Naming the template covers every
    # instance, including ones somebody adds later.

sub services {

    # Not the template: systemctl refuses to restart one, because a template is
    # not a thing that runs.  postfix.service is the wrapper the package enables
    # and every instance is PartOf it, so restarting it takes the instances with
    # it -- which is what the packaging intends you to do.
    return ('postfix.service');
}

=head2 accumulates($key)

True for the list parameters above.  Never true of a master.cf entry, which is a
row rather than a list: two fragments configuring one service disagree about it,
and the later one wins.  The base class's comma is therefore the only separator
this language ever needs.

=cut

sub accumulates {
    my ( $self, $key ) = @_;
    return $ACCUMULATES{$key} // 0;
}

=head2 parse($text)

Read a fragment of either file.

Which one is worked out from the text rather than from a filename, because a
C<main.cf> line and a C<master.cf> line cannot be mistaken for each other: the
first has an C<=> and the second is a row of columns.
