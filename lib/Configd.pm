=head1 NAME

Configd - give software without a conf.d one anyway.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Configd();

    my @known = Configd->languages();
    my $postfix = Configd->language('postfix');

    Configd->adopt('postfix');    # take the files over, wrap the service
    Configd->build('postfix');    # regenerate, which the unit does for you
    Configd->release('postfix');  # give them back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Postfix keeps its configuration in F</etc/postfix/main.cf> and offers
C<postconf -e> to change it.  That is fine for a person at a terminal and wrong
for anything automated, because C<postconf -e> B<sets> a parameter -- there is no
way to B<add> to one.

Provisioning a second domain onto a mail server that already hosts one is enough
to hit it:

    postconf -e "mydestination = first.example.com"     # the first domain
    postconf -e "mydestination = second.example.com"    # the second

The second run does not add the second domain.  It replaces the first, and mail
for C<first.example.com> quietly stops being delivered locally.  Nothing errors,
nothing logs, and the two provisioning runs had no way to know about each other.

Software that ships a C<conf.d> does not have this problem: each thing drops in a
file and the daemon reads them all.  Plenty of software does not ship one.

=head2 What this does

C<configd adopt postfix> gives it one anyway:

=over 4

=item * F</etc/postfix/main.cf> becomes B<generated output>.

=item * F</etc/postfix/main.cf.d/> appears beside it, holding fragments in
main.cf's own syntax.

=item * Whatever was in main.cf becomes C<main.cf.d/00-original>, so the
distribution's defaults and anything the administrator had done keep winning
wherever nothing later has an opinion.

=item * A systemd drop-in regenerates the file every time the service starts or
reloads, so what the daemon reads is always what the fragments say.

=back

Two domains can then each write their own file and both get what they asked for:

    mydestination = $myhostname, localhost, first.example.com, second.example.com

=head2 Which settings merge, and which do not

This is the whole design decision, and it is per setting.

Most are B<values>: two fragments setting C<myhostname> disagree, and the later
one wins.  Some are B<lists>: two fragments each naming a domain in
C<mydestination> both meant it, and joining them is the only answer that does not
lose one.  A language says which is which by overriding C<accumulates>.

L<Configd::Language::postfix> deliberately does B<not> accumulate
C<smtpd_recipient_restrictions> and its relatives, even though they are lists.
They are I<ordered> lists where the order is the meaning, and joining two end to
end produces something that parses and that neither fragment asked for -- a
C<permit_> landing ahead of a check that was supposed to run first is an open
relay.  Two fragments disagreeing about a restriction list is something a person
should look at.

=head2 Caveats

B<Comments are not carried into the generated file.>  A comment is anchored to
the setting below it, and once several fragments have had their say there may be
no such setting any more -- reproducing the distribution's paragraph above a
value that has since been replaced tells the reader something untrue.  They stay
in the fragment they were written in, and C<00-original> keeps every one the file
arrived with.

B<Editing the generated file works until the next restart.>  That is deliberate:
long enough to test something, short enough that nobody comes to rely on it.  The
header on the file says so.

=head2 Requirements

Core perl 5.34 or newer, and nothing else.  Deliberately: this runs from
C<ExecStartPre>, so it stands between a service and starting, and it has to work
on whatever perl the guest already has rather than one somebody installed first.
Ubuntu 24.04 ships 5.38 and 22.04 ships 5.34.

L<Configd::Language> is where the design is written down and what you subclass
to teach it a new format.  Read the part about checking for a native C<conf.d>
first: this is for software that has none, and using it where a real mechanism
exists trades a working feature for a moving part.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 languages()

The languages this installation knows about, by name.

Found by looking through C<@INC> rather than by keeping a list, so a language
dropped in by a site -- or by a distribution that ships one -- is found without
anything here being edited.

=cut

sub languages {
    my ($class) = @_;

    my %seen;
    foreach my $dir (@INC) {
        my $path = "$dir/Configd/Language";
        opendir( my $dh, $path ) or next;
        foreach my $file ( readdir($dh) ) {
            next unless $file =~ m/\A(\w+)[.]pm\z/;
            $seen{$1} = 1;
        }
        closedir $dh;
    }

    return sort keys %seen;
}

=head2 language($name, %opts)

One language, loaded and instantiated. C<%opts> reaches its constructor, which
is how C<root> gets there.

Dies naming what is available when there is no such language, because the
alternative is a typo looking exactly like a language that does not handle the
file you expected.

=cut

sub language {
    my ( $class, $name, %opts ) = @_;

    die "Which language?\n" unless defined $name && length $name;

    # It becomes part of a module name, so it has to be a name and not a path.
    die "'$name' is not a language name\n" unless $name =~ m/\A\w+\z/;

    my $module = "Configd::Language::$name";
    eval { Module::Load::load($module); 1 } or do {
        my @known = $class->languages();
        die "No language '$name'. This installation knows: " . join( ', ', @known ) . "\n";
    };

    return $module->new(%opts);
}

=head2 build($name, %opts)

Regenerate every file a language manages, returning the paths that changed.

This is what the systemd drop-in runs, so it does exactly this and nothing else:
no C<systemctl>, which would deadlock against the start it is part of, and no
adopting, because a service starting is not the time to be taking files over.

=cut

sub build {
    my ( $class, $name, %opts ) = @_;

    my $language = $class->language( $name, %opts );

    my @changed;
    foreach my $file ( $language->files() ) {
        push @changed, $file->{path} if $language->write($file);
    }

    return @changed;
}

=head2 adopt($name, %opts)

Take a language's files over and wrap its service: move each file into its own
fragment directory as C<00-original>, generate it, and install the drop-in.

Returns a hashref of what happened, which is what the command line prints.  Its
C<services> is what to restart, which is not always what the drop-in went on --
see L<Configd::Language/services()>.

Safe to run again: a file already adopted is regenerated rather than adopted a
second time, and re-adopting is the one thing that would duplicate every setting
in it.

Reloading systemd and restarting the service are the caller's, so that a caller
building an image rather than configuring a running machine can skip them.

=cut

sub adopt {
    my ( $class, $name, %opts ) = @_;

    my $language = $class->language( $name, %opts );
    my @adopted  = $language->adopt();
    my $unit     = Configd::Unit->new( language => $language, %opts );

    return {
        adopted  => \@adopted,
        dropins  => [ $unit->install() ],
        services => [ $language->services() ],
    };
}

=head2 release($name, %opts)

Give a language's files back: restore each C<00-original> and remove the
drop-in.

The fragment directories are left alone. They are somebody's configuration, and
throwing them away on the way out means a release followed by an adopt loses
everything that was ever added.

=cut

sub release {
    my ( $class, $name, %opts ) = @_;

    my $language = $class->language( $name, %opts );
    my $unit     = Configd::Unit->new( language => $language, %opts );

    return {
        dropins  => [ $unit->uninstall() ],
        released => [ $language->release() ],
        services => [ $language->services() ],
    };
}

=head2 status($name, %opts)

What a language is doing right now: its files, whether each is adopted, how many
fragments it has, and whether the drop-in is in place.

=cut

sub status {
    my ( $class, $name, %opts ) = @_;

    my $language = $class->language( $name, %opts );
    my $unit     = Configd::Unit->new( language => $language, %opts );

    my @files;
    foreach my $file ( $language->files() ) {
        my @fragments = $language->fragments($file);
        push @files, {
            path      => $file->{path},
            adopted   => ( scalar grep { basename($_) eq '00-original' } @fragments ) ? 1 : 0,
            fragments => [ map { basename($_) } @fragments ],
        };
    }

    return {
        language => $language->name(),
        files    => \@files,
        units    => [ $language->units() ],
        wrapped  => $unit->installed(),
    };
}
